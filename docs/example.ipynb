    "The following instructions are currently supported by picometer (as of version 0.1.2):\n",
    "- **Input/output instructions**\n",
    "  - `load` model from a cif file, given `filename` or mapping syntax:\n",
    "    `{path: filename.cif, block: cif_block}`.\n",
    "  - `write` table with all evaluations to a csv file.\n",
    "- **Selection instructions**\n",
    "  - `select` atoms, groups, or shapes to be used; use raw element names\n",
    "    or provide symmetry relation / recenter using mapping syntax, for example:\n",
    "    `{label: C(11), symm: x;-y;z+1/2, at: Fe(1)}`.\n",
    "    By default, selection is cleared after calling `select` with no arguments\n",
    "    or calling an aggregating or evaluating instruction.\n",
    "  - `recenter` selection around a new centroid;\n",
    "      this action is applied to every selected item individually,\n",
    "      so to recenter fixed group of atoms, `group` them first and recenter\n",
    "      this group - otherwise you will recenter individual atoms instead.\n",
    "- **Aggregation instructions**\n",
    "  - `group` current selection into a new object with fixed elements.\n",
    "  - fit `centroid` to the current atom / centroid selection;\n",
    "  - fit `line` to the current atom / centroid selection;\n",
    "  - fit `plane` to the currect atom / centroid selection;\n",
    "- **Evaluation instructions**\n",
    "  - measure `distance` between 2 selected objects; if the selection includes\n",
    "    groups of atoms, measure closes distance to the group of atoms.\n",
    "  - measure `angle` between 2–6 selected objects; if the selection includes\n",
    "    (ordered) atoms, calculate direct or dihedral angle between presumed bonds."
